🪪 Animated Business Card (HTML + CSS)
This project is a responsive and stylish digital business card built using only HTML and CSS. It includes personalized design features such as a custom color palette, hover effects, shadows, and smooth animations.

✨ Features
💡 Modern layout with flexbox

🎨 Custom color palette inspired by Coolors.co

🖼️ Avatar/profile image support

✍️ Web-safe fonts

🐭 Hover effects with elevation and color shift

🎬 CSS animations (fade-in and hover pulse)

🔲 Optional dotted border for debugging or styling

📦 Fully self-contained and easy to customize

🚀 How It Works
The .card component uses flexbox to arrange content horizontally.

On page load, the card fades in from the bottom using @keyframes fadeInUp.

On hover, the card lifts slightly with a shadow effect and changes background color, with an optional pulse animation.
